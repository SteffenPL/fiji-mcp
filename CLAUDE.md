# fiji-mcp

MCP server bridging LLM agents with a running Fiji instance via WebSocket. Gives LLMs a scripting interface into a biologist's live Fiji session.

## Architecture

```
LLM Agent → (stdio MCP) → Python server → (ws://localhost:8765) → Fiji + Java plugin
```

- **Python** (`src/fiji_mcp/`): fastmcp server, WebSocket client, event buffer
- **Java** (`fiji-plugin/`): Fiji plugin, WebSocket server, script executor, event emitter

## Design principles

- Scripting-first: LLM composes via `run_ij_macro` / `run_script` / `run_command`, no curated wrappers
- File-based image I/O: Fiji saves to temp, MCP returns paths — no base64 in the protocol
- Requests matched to responses by `id`; events are fire-and-forget from Fiji's side

## Java builds

The Java plugin targets **Java 8** for maximum Fiji compatibility. Fiji is installed at `~/Fiji` and ships with a bundled Zulu JDK 21 at `~/Fiji/java/macos-arm64/zulu21.42.19-ca-jdk21.0.7-macosx_aarch64/zulu-21.jdk/Contents/Home`. `JAVA_HOME` points there automatically in Claude Code sessions via `.claude/settings.local.json`.

```
cd fiji-plugin && mvn package -q
cp target/fiji-mcp-bridge-0.1.0.jar ../Fiji/plugins/
```

Note: the Jaunch launcher's `--run` flag has known issues (fiji/fiji#416).

## Configuration

- Port: `8765` (override via `FIJI_MCP_PORT`, read by both Python and Java)
- Fiji path: saved to `.fiji-path` by `fiji-mcp install`, overridable via `--fiji-home` CLI arg or `FIJI_HOME` env (fallback)
- Default execution hard ceiling: 600s (configurable per call via `hard_timeout_seconds`); opt-in long-poll via `soft_timeout_seconds` plus `wait_for_execution` and `kill_execution`
- WebSocket connect timeout: 5s

## Launching Fiji

The MCP server auto-launches Fiji when the Fiji path is known (from `.fiji-path`, `--fiji-home`, or `FIJI_HOME`) and the bridge plugin is installed. On first tool call, if the bridge WebSocket is not reachable, the server launches `<fiji>/fiji -eval 'run("Start Bridge");'` and polls for readiness.

## Eval harness

Evaluation tasks live under `tests/evals/` with reference algorithms kept separate in `tests/evals-internal/` (hidden from subagents to prevent copying).

```
tests/
├── unit/                    # Python unit tests (pytest)
├── evals/
│   ├── run_eval.md          # orchestrator prompt (run as Claude Code session)
│   ├── nucleus-seg/         # one task directory per eval
│   │   ├── prompt.md        # subagent task instructions
│   │   ├── check.py         # deterministic metric checker (IoU, cell counts)
│   │   └── fixtures/
│   │       ├── nuclei.tif   # input image
│   │       └── generate_nuclei.py
│   └── results/             # gitignored, regenerated each run
│       └── summary.json
├── evals-internal/          # ground-truth pipelines, invisible to subagents
│   └── nucleus-seg/
│       └── ground_truth.ijm
└── examples/                # sample MCP client configs
    └── test-env/
```

Key conventions:

- **Orchestrator** (`tests/evals/run_eval.md`) is an LLM-driven prompt, not a shell script — it can adapt to failures and scale to parallel subagents.
- **Subagent isolation**: each task is spawned as an independent Agent so it can't see other tasks or reference algorithms.
- **File-based checking**: `check.py` scores actual output artifacts (masks, tables) rather than parsing LLM prose.
- **Shared bridge**: the same running Fiji instance generates ground truth and runs subagent tasks.

## Bug tracking

This project uses `tk` for issue tracking. Tickets live in `.tickets/` as markdown files with short prefix-matching IDs (e.g. `fm-9cbk`).

- `tk list` — all tickets
- `tk ready` — unblocked open/in-progress tickets, sorted by priority
- `tk blocked` — open tickets waiting on dependencies
- `tk closed` — recently closed
- `tk show <id>` — full ticket (partial IDs work)
- `tk create "title" -t bug -p 1 --external-ref feedback-4 --tags bridge,observability -d "..."` — new ticket
- `tk start <id>` / `tk close <id>` / `tk reopen <id>` — status transitions
- `tk dep <id> <blocker>` — dependency (directional); `tk link <id> <id>` — symmetric link
- `tk --help` for everything else

Conventions for this repo:
- **Feedback sessions** are the canonical source for bridge UX bugs and proposals. When creating tickets from feedback, set `--external-ref feedback-N` and tag `feedback`.
- **Priority 0** is reserved for bugs that silently break core workflows (e.g. an observability gap that hides other bugs, or a regression that makes a canonical ImageJ command return wrong answers).
- **Link vs dep**: use `tk dep` only when one ticket literally cannot start until another is done (e.g. eval harness depends on headless mode). Use `tk link` for "these two fixes are related / would have caught each other" — the common case for observability bugs.
- When running `tk create` from tool calls, always capture the returned ID so follow-up `tk close` / `tk dep` / `tk link` calls can use it.

## Structural code search with ast-grep

Use `ast-grep` for queries that are about code *shape* rather than text: bug-family sweeps after finding one instance, refactoring checks, finding all members of a structural family (listener callbacks, decorated handlers, catch blocks).

```
ast-grep --lang java --pattern 'try { $$$ } catch (Throwable $V) { $$$BODY }' fiji-plugin/src/main/java
ast-grep --lang python --pattern '@mcp.tool
async def $FN($$$ARGS) -> $RET: $$$BODY' src/fiji_mcp/
```

`$VAR` matches one node, `$$$VARS` matches a sequence.
